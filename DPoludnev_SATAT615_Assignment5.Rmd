1. (based on p. 93: 2.18) For conducting statistical tests concerning the parameter 𝛽1, why is the
𝑡-test more versatile than the 𝐹-test (think about what can be tested and be concluded based
on each test)?
```{r}
#The F test is used for comparing two standard deviations and variability while t test can be a normal t test and paired t test. While F test checks for variability, the t test can have alternative hypothesis of less or greater than, also t test can be used to for one-sided alternative hypothesis making it more versatile than the F test.
```
2. (based on p. 93: 2.19) When testing 𝐻0: 𝛽1 = 0 versus 𝐻𝐴: 𝛽1 ≠ 0 , why is the 𝐹-test a onesided test even though 𝐻𝐴includes both cases 𝛽1 < 0 and 𝛽1 > 0?
```{r}
#The F test is based on ratio and if it is closer to one the null hypothesis is true, if it is more than one then it proves both B1 > 0 and B1 < 0.
```

(based on p. 91: 2.10) For each of the following questions, explain whether a confidence interval for a mean
response or a prediction interval for a new observation is appropriate.
a) What will be the humidity level in this greenhouse tomorrow when we set the temperature level at
31oC?
```{r}

```
b) How much do families whose disposable income is $23,500 spend, on the average, for meals away
from home?
```{r}

```
c) How many kilowatt-hours of electricity will be consumed next month by commercial and industrial
users in the Twin Cities service area, given that the index of business activity for the area remains at
its present level?
```{r}


```
4. (based on p. 91: 2.11) Is there a difference between the “mean response at 𝑋 = 𝑋ℎ” and the “mean of m
new observations at 𝑋 = 𝑋ℎ”? Why or why not? Please justify your answer.
```{r}

```
